### Cloud Provider Cost Comparison
- Disclaimer: The following is a very rough estimate based on general pricing trends and assumptions. Actual costs can vary significantly based on specific usage patterns, region, and other factors.

#### Estimated Monthly Costs (Approximate):

Assuming a moderate-sized cluster with the following configuration:

- Kubernetes nodes: 3 nodes (c5.2xlarge)
- Storage: 1 TB of EFS and 500 GB of EBS
- Network traffic: 100 GB/month
- Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana
- AWS EKS: Approximately $1,500-$2,000 per month.

- GKE: Approximately $1,200-$1,800 per month.

- AKS: Approximately $1,400-$2,000 per month.

- DigitalOcean Kubernetes: Approximately `$800-$1,

200` per month.

### Key Factors Affecting Costs:

- `Region:` Prices can vary significantly between regions.
- `Instance types:` The specific instance types used will affect costs.
- `Storage usage:` The amount of data stored and accessed will influence storage costs.
- `Network traffic:` The volume of network traffic will impact network costs.
- `Monitoring tools:` The complexity and resource requirements of monitoring tools can affect costs.
