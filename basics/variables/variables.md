## Variables in golang
```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declare a variable with its type
    var myVariable int
    myVariable = 42

    // Declare and initialize a variable in one line
    anotherVariable := "Hello, World!"

    fmt.Println(myVariable)
    fmt.Println(anotherVariable)
}
```
### Notes on Variables in Golang:
- Variables in Go are declared using the `var` keyword, followed by the `variable name` and `its type`.
- You can also declare and initialize a variable in one line using the `:=` operator, which is known as the `short assignment statement`.
- Go is a `statically typed` language, so you must specify the type of each variable when declaring it.
- In the provided code snippet, `myVariable` is declared as an `int` and initialized with the value `42`. `anotherVariable` is declared and initialized as a string with the value `"Hello`, World!".
- The `fmt.Println()` function is used to print the values of the variables to the console.
